I recently built a Machine Learning model to predict Alzheimer’s predisposition using a dataset of more than 74,000 records. By utilizing a Random Forest Classifier, I achieved a 71% accuracy rate in identifying potential risk factors.
I used the data from Kaggle. 

Key Findings:

Age remains the primary driver, but BMI and Cognitive Test Scores followed closely as high-impact predictors.

Modifiable factors like Diet, Sleep Quality, and Physical Activity showed measurable influence on the model’s decisions, highlighting the power of lifestyle interventions.

Accuracy measures the total percentage of correct predictions out of all cases tested. Our result: 71%
Out of every 100 people in your test set, your model correctly identified the status (either "Alzheimer's" or "No Alzheimer's") for 71 of them.

Precision measures how many of the people the model labeled as having Alzheimer's actually had the disease. Our Result: 66% for having Alzheimer (1).
When our model identifies a person and says "This person has Alzheimer's," it is correct 66% of the time.
This also means 34% of the time, the model predicts someone has the disease when they actually do not (False Positives).

In our results, our Recall for Alzheimer's was 64%.
Recall asks "How many actual sick people did the model find?".
The "Missed" Cases: Your recall of 64% means that for every 100 people who truly have Alzheimer's, your model successfully identifies 64 of them but misses 36 (False Negatives).
False Negatives are more crucial than False Positives in clinical data, therefore further refinement is required.
